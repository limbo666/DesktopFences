Desktop Fences + creates **virtual fences** on your desktop, allowing you to group and organize icons in a clean and convenient way. With enhanced visual effects and right-click options, it aims to provide a more polished and customizable user interface.


**Desktop Fences+** is an open-source alternative to Stardock Fences, originally created by [HakanKokcu](https://github.com/HakanKokcu) under the name BirdyFences.

This project is a continuation and substantial modification of the original BirdyFences codebase, which was licensed under the MIT License at the time of forking. 

Desktop Fences+ has been significantly enhanced and optimized for improved performance, stability, and user experience, while respecting the terms of the original license and acknowledging the original author.
