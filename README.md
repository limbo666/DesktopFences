Desktop Fences + creates **virtual fences** on your desktop, allowing you to group and organize icons in a clean and convenient way. With enhanced visual effects and right-click options, it aims to provide a more polished and customizable user interface.
**Desktop Fences +** is an open-source alternative to **Stardock Fences**, originally created by [HakanKokcu](https://github.com/HakanKokcu) under the name **BirdyFences**.  
**Desktop Fences +** has been significantly enhanced and optimized for improved performance, stability, and user experience.
